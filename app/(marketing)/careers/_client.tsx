                We believe that the highest-impact AI research requires combining rigorous science with practical engineering.
                At Zoo, we work as a cohesive team on large-scale research efforts across AI, cryptography, and distributed systems.
              </p>
              <p className={cn("mb-4", "text-muted-foreground")}>
                Our research spans multiple domains: from frontier AI models (the Zen family) to post-quantum cryptography,
                from novel consensus protocols to privacy-preserving computation. We publish openly and contribute to open source.
              </p>
              <p className={cn("text-muted-foreground")}>
                We value impact over individual publications. We're looking for people who want to work on hard problems
                that matter and who can collaborate effectively across disciplines.
